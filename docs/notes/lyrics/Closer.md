**Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you**

**I drink too much and that's an issue**

**But I'm okay**

**Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them**

**But I hope I never see them again**

**I know it breaks your heart**

**Moved to the city in a broke down car and**

**Four years no calls**

**Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and**

**I-I-I-I-I can't stop**

**No, I-I-I-I-I can't stop**

**So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover**

**That I know you can't afford**

**Bite that tattoo on your shoulder**

**Pull the sheets right off the corner**

**Of the mattress that you stole**

**From your roommate back in Boulder**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**You, look as good as the day I met you**

**I forgot just why I left you, I was insane**

**Stay, and play that Blink-182 song**

**That we beat to death in Tucson**

**OK**

**I know it breaks your heart**

**Moved to the city in a broke down car and**

**Four years no calls**

**Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar and**

**I-I-I-I-I can't stop**

**No, I-I-I-I-I can't stop**

**So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover**

**That I know you can't afford**

**Bite that tattoo on your shoulder**

**Pull the sheets right off the corner**

**Of the mattress that you stole**

**From your roommate back in Boulder**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover**

**That I know you can't afford**

**Bite that tattoo on your shoulder**

**Pull the sheets right off the corner**

**Of the mattress that you stole**

**From your roommate back in Boulder**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**We ain't ever getting older, no, we ain't ever getting older**

**We ain't ever getting older**

**No, we ain't ever getting older**
