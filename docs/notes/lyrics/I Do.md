**My whole world changed**

**from the moment I met you**

**and it would never be the same**

**felt like I knew that I'd always loved you**

**from the moment I heard your name**

**everything was perfect**

**I knew this love was worth it**

**our own miracle in the making**

**until this world stops turning**

**I'll still be here waiting and waiting**

**to make that vow that I'll**

**I'll be by your side till the day I die**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**something old, something new**

**something borrowed, something blue**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**smiles by the thousands**

**ya tears have all dried out**

**cause I won't see you cry again**

**throw pennies in a fountain**

**look at what comes out**

**sometimes wishes do come true**

**now everything is perfect**

**I know this love is worth it**

**our own miracle in the making**

**until this world stops turning**

**I'll still be here waiting and waiting**

**to make that vow that I'll**

**I'll be by your side till the day I die**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**something old, something new**

**something borrowed, something blue**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**always better than worse**

**protect you from the hurt**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**I do love you, yes I do love you**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**cause I love you, love you**

**I'll be by your side till the day I die**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**something old, something new**

**something borrowed, something blue**

**I'll be waiting till I hear you say I do**

**we're shining like a diamond**

**just look at us now**

**I wanna hear you say I do**
